<h3>What are Snippets?</h3>
<p>From Wikipedia:
<blockquote class="content-quote">
Snippet is a programming term for a small region of re-usable source code, machine code, or text. Ordinarily, these are formally-defined operative units to incorporate into larger programming modules. Snippets are often used to clarify the meaning of an otherwise "cluttered" function, or to minimize the use of repeated code that is common to other functions.
